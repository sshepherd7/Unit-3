    <h1> Knox Three Tracts </h1>
    <p> The difficulties attending the plan for the instruction of the negro slaves in our colonines are very different from the obstacles
      which present themselves to the conversion of the North American Indians. The quick sagacity of the Indian keeps him aloof from 
      every attempt to convert him. The dull stupidity of the Negroe leaves him without any desire for instruction. </p>
    <p> Whether the Creator originally formed these black people a little lower than other men, or that they have lost their intellectual 
      powers through disuse, I will not assume the province of determining; but certain it is, that a new Negroe (as those lately imported 
      from Africa are called) is a complete definitionof indolent stupidity, nor could a more forcible means be employed for the conversion 
      of a deist, than setting one of these creatures before him, as an example of a man in a state of nature, unibiased by revelation or 
      education. </p>
    <p> Their stupidity does not however authorize us to consider them as beasts for our uses, much less to deny them all knowledge of the 
      common salvation. </p>
    <p> The Negroes born in our colonies are undoubtedly capable of receiving instruction, and those who are born among the French are 
      instructed in the Roman Catholic religion; but our planters are generally averse to their Negroes being taught any thing but labour, 
      and yetthe generality of our North American planters have a regard for religion, and are punctual in the discharge of its duties, 
      as far as they think themselves obliged by them. How this comes to pass must be our first inquiry; for unless the planter can be 
      prevailed on to give his assistance, it will be in vain to propose any method for instructing his slaves. </p>
    <p> Our planters objections to their Negroes being instructed is simply this, that instruction renders them less fit or less 
      willing to labour. Experience justifies their opion, and a little reflection will convince us that must be the consequence. </p>
